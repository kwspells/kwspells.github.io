    <h1>My name is Kenneth Spells</h1> 
     
      <p>Me and my Wife have two beautiful kids Kendell(9) and Lilly(4). I currently stay in Durham, NC me and my 
           family moved back to the area about three years ago to be closer to family and friends. After staying in Greensboro, NC for about 10 years.
	   This is where I meet my Wife while attending North Carolina A&T as undergrad students. In 2015 I obtain 
	   my Bachelors Degree in Computer Aided Design and have been working in that field every since. I am currently seeking to get into the
	   IT world which is why I am currently enrolled at Wake Tech in pursuit of an Computer Programming Degree.
